       <h3>STEPS</h3>    
            <ol>
                <li>To prepare the pasta, fill a large pot with 5 liters of water and bring it to a high heat.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a shallow pan and sauté the bacon for 2-3 minutes until it starts to brown.</li>
                <li>Transfer the bacon to a plate, add another 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the pan, and sauté the onion over medium heat for 4-5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once the water in the large pot starts boiling, add 35 grams of salt and add the Spaghetti No. 6 MISKO.</li>
                <li>Stir with a fork and let them boil for the time indicated on the package.</li>
                <li>When the onion has softened, add the minced garlic, sauté for 1 minute, and pour in the light cream, bacon, and freshly ground pepper.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat and let all the ingredients simmer for 4-5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Towards the end, add half of the grated cheese, stirring it in.</li>
                <li>Using quick motions, transfer the cooked pasta directly from the pot to the sauce and gently mix to evenly coat the ingredients.</li>
                <li>If the <em>carbonara</em> sauce is too thick, add some of the water in which the pasta boiled and continue stirring.</li>
                <li>Serve the <em>Carbonara</em> immediately, sprinkling it with the remaining grated cheese.</li>
            </ol>
